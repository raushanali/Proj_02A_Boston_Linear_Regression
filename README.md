# Proj_02A_Boston_Linear_Regression

This project is based on the Boston Housing Dataset. It uses a Linear Regression model to predict the average price (MEDV) of homes in the Boston area. The dataset includes 11 features (such as crime rate, number of rooms, tax, etc.).

Purpose
Goal: To predict house prices based on various social and environmental factors.

Main Features:
Load and process the Boston Housing dataset
Split the data into training and testing sets
Train a Linear Regression model and evaluate its performance (MSE, R2 score)
Visualize the comparison between actual and predicted prices (scatter plot)

How to Use
Place the BostonHousing.csv file with this project.
Run the code in Python (make sure pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib are installed).
After running the code, you will get the MSE and R2 scores for training and testing, along with a graph comparing the actual and predicted prices.
